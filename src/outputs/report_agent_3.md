Thought: I have carefully reviewed the provided context and the strict filtering criteria. I will evaluate each event against the four criteria: nationwide recognition/participation, documented retail sales impact, exclusion of regional/minor observances, and comparable commercial impact to benchmarks (Diwali, Holi, Raksha Bandhan, Independence Day, Republic Day, major e-commerce sales). I will also calculate the days remaining from August 01, 2025, for each qualifying event and format the output as required.
